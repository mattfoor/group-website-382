            <h3>Carmen Berzatto</h3>
            <p>Co-Founder</p>
            <p>Carmen "Carmy" Berzatto bootstrapped this company after the passing of his older Brother Michael. Carmy studied Marketing and Business Law at Harvard, and wants Acme to be the leader in its field. In his free time, Carmy is working on a quirky new phone case design for Acme, or cooking some fancy dish inspired by his time studying abroad.</p>

            <h3>Sydney Adamu</h3>  
            <p>Co-Founder and Head of Operations</p>
            <p> Sydney followed Carmy out of Harvard and into Acme. Sydney is really the glue that keeps the team together and is a hard but fair task master. After majoring in Supply Chain and Business Analytics, she wanted nothing more than to build her own business from the ground up. Apart from overseeing Acme's day-to-day, Sydney is volunteering at no-kill dog shelters, thrifting and sewing, and making gelato from scratch.</p>

            <h3>Ebon Moss-Bacharach</h3>
            <p>Hardware Engineer</p>
            <p>Ebon is the zaniest person you will ever meet - he is the human embodiment of the "never let them know your next move" trend. But there is nobody that gets the job done as well as he can - he is deft, sharp and crazy all at once. When he's not designing and hand-selecting components for our products, Ebon is jamming to Taylor Swift with his kiddo, going on wine trail tours, and painting.</p>

            <h3>Matty Matheson</h3>
            <p>Software Engineer</p>
            <p>Strike what we last said, Matty is definitely the zaniest person you will ever meet. When Ebon and him are in the room together, it's pure chaos - but the productive kind. Matty is responsible for our cutting-edge quality of our products - in collaboration with the Engineering team, he ensures that you receive only the "creme de la creme." When he's not at his messy office desk looking for parts and samples, he is on FaceTime with his grandparents, watching obscure anime, or shopping for rare Squishmallows.</p>

            <h3>Lionel Boyce</h3>
            <p>Embedded Software Engineer</p>
            <p>Lionel Boyce programs microcontrollers and interfaces electronics with code and Lionel wanted this intro be boring so he can appear "professional." Well we want to tell Lionel that that is not happening - L-Boy as we refer to him is the member of the team that is always playing rap in the office, more often than not, it is Punjabi rap. Apart from working on his beloved PC that he built, he is taking his 6 dogs to the park, going to Pilates classes, or snacking on Subways.</p>

            <p>Chief Marketing Officer</p>
            <p>Ah, I'm finally writing about myself! In short, I am responsible for making all of them look good, especially on camera - you're welcome for photoshopping your zit out Ebon. When I'm not at the office, I'm grabbing Boba with my husband, going to stand-up comedy shows, and collecting stamps.</p>

            <h3>Natalie Berzatto</h3>
            <p>Social Media Manager</p>
            <p>Let's be honest, our social media page is great, otherwise why would Michelle Obama be following it? When I'm not making my team look better, I am doing puzzles, finishing the Wordle (I have a 367 day streak), and watching college football. </p>

            <h3>James Kalinowski</h3>
            <p>Head of Sustainability</p>
            <p>Apart from being a major shareholder at Acme, James or fondly called "Cicero/Jimmy," is a nerd for saving the planet. He is the one making sure that we are setting rigorous science based targets. When he's not delivering sustainability talks, he's making it difficult for us to get a photograph of him, is playing golf (duh), and is making the best hot Italian sandwich known to man. </p>

            <p>Materials Researcher</p>
            <p>Ebraheim is our team's "Little Einstein." He researches renewavle materials and is responsible for optimising our processes and products. When he's not in a remote location doing his research, he is playing GTA 5, doing coding classes, and giving people haircuts.</p>
